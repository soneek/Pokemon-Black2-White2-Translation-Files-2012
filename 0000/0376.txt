Long time, no see? Or hello?\xfffeI don't remember, but hey there!
Yahoho! Yahohoy!\xfffeI won again!
Toho... Tohohoy...\xfffeI lost again...
Alright, let's rock!\xfffeI'll show you my power!
Shocked?! Startled?!\xfffeThat's the power of my Pokémon!!
Your power is amazing!\xfffeShocking and startling!
M-May aye help yuu?!
Oh! Ohhh!\xfffeYes we can?!
Uh-uh-unbelievivable?!
Youngster, if you're not prepared,\xfffeyou might be cryin' in a hurry!
Youngsters can beat adults\xfffeif their Pokémon are strong!
Yeesh! You're still a youngster!\xfffeBut you're brutal in battle...!
My heart's thumping is exciting me!\xfffeLet's Pokémon battle!
Mwoohoohoo! Mwoohoohoo number two!\xfffeGlee! I won, I won!
You thumped me with a thump!\xfffeAnd I'm beat like a... beet?
Serious battles start seriously!\xfffeAre you ready and set to go?
Seriously winning a serious battle\xfffeis seriously awesome!
Seriously losing is seriously painful.\xfffeBut you're seriously cool, I'd say!
Be gentle!\xfffeIt's my first time...!
Ooh, I won... um, were you...\xfffeWere you going easy on me?
Aaah! It huuurts!\xfffeBut... ooh, you're just so good...
U-Um... these Pokémon\xfffeare my favorites!
S-s-s-sorry...!\xfffeI just wanted to introduce them!
Just being with these guys\xfffemakes me really happy...
...Gwahaha! I have faith in my\xfffecalculations and analysis!
Gwaha! Just as calculated...\xfffeOf course I couldn't lose!
Mrrrgh... My calculations and analysis\xfffedidn't quite prepare for that...
We're having a Pokémon battle!\xfffeSo let's do our greetings!
That was pretty pathetic...\xfffeBut for now, thank you very much!
You've brought me to tears...\xfffeBut for now, thank you very much!
I study day after day...\xfffeSo this is a change of pace!
Whew, Pokémon battles ARE fun!\xfffeI want to study Pokémon!
My Pokémon lost already...\xfffeShould I keep to studying?
When I grow up, I wanna be\xfffea Pokémon researcher guy!
I wonder if Pokémon research\xfffeinvolves dissections and stuff...?
I battle hard so I can\xfffeknow more about Pokémon!
Ah... a strong-looking trainer.\xfffeWill I hold up, I wonder...?
Oh-la-la? A surprising result...\xfffeYou can't judge a book by its cover...
Yes, you are a strong trainer!\xfffePeople truly are their appearances.
Always at the top of the charts!\xfffeAlways shooting for number one!
Win! Win! Win!\xfffe'Cause that makes you number one!
I can't be number one\xfffeif I'm losing this badly!
Uhn? Yew battlin' me?\xfffeGuessah mightah swell!
Aaah, dun't seyt!\xfffeDun'tchew blame meee...
Impresshive... 'em no match...\xfffeYer Pokémon 'er tuff...
Ugh... grumble...\xfffemumble... moan...
Ugh... grumble...\xfffe...Wuh? I won?
Ugh... grumble...\xfffe...Wuh? Over already?
Burdened with the weight of the future,\xfffethe Super Ace makes his entrance!
There's a difference in our character!\xfffeI worry for your future!
I was too overconfident!\xfffeI worry for my future!
Huh? You're my opponent?\xfffeYou look like you're starving!
Are you eating well?\xfffeYou can't run on an empty stomach!
Are you SURE you're just ordinary?\xfffeWhat are you EATING?
I'm an up-and-coming celebrity!\xfffeI'm stingy with my money!
Sorry, but you lose.\xfffeNow give me my allowance!
I lost... but I'm not\xfffegiving you my allowance!
I got these Pokémon from my mommy!\xfffeNot even thinking about losing!
Look, mommy!\xfffeIf you can hear me, I'm okay!
Mommy! MOMMYYY! Where are you?!\xfffeMake me feel betteeeeer!
Suddenly! A fanciful trainer!\xfffeAnd if the battle is fanciful too...
You lost... to me...?\xfffeNot quite what I hoped for...
Oh, the battle was fanciful...\xfffeI got swept up in it too...
What Pokémon do you prefer?\xfffeHey, go on and show me!
Your Pokémon tastes are good...\xfffeToo bad about the training part!
Your Pokémon tastes aren't great,\xfffebut you're a first-class trainer!
Sorry if I tell any lies.\xfffeAhem! I am NOT a prestigious lady!
When I pretend to be a lady,\xfffeI always get pampered!
I'm actually just an underling,\xfffea businessman's daughter...
Hohoho...
Ohohoho...
Tohohoho...
I'm your kindergartener opponent!\xfffePleased to meet you!
I'm a kindergartener winner!\xfffeThank you very much!
I'm a kindergartener loser!\xfffeThank you very much!
I am a kindergartener genius!\xfffeI'm already applying to colleges!
Losing to a kindergartener...\xfffeHow old are you, anyway?
I'm proud of my studies,\xfffebut I'm still a kid in Pokémon...
I am a HEROMAN!\xfffeI cannot lose!
'Cause I am a heroman!\xfffeI beat up badguymen!
A heroman should not lose!\xfffeIt is not something heromen do!
I'm reeeally strong!\xfffeSo I'm reeeally not gonna lose!
My dad gave me this Pokamon!\xfffeSo I knew I was strong!
PWEEEEEN!!
I think it's bizarre how\xfffepeople complain when they lose.
There's so much joy when you win!\xfffeHeck yeah! Go, everything!!
Well... I lost...\xfffeIt hurts, but it was my fault.
You bullyin' me? You bullyin' me?
You didn't bully me!\xfffeI like you a bunch!
You bullied me, but you're strong!\xfffeSo I still like you!
C'mon! Pokamooooon!\xfffeDo your best, okaaay?!
Heehee! We did it! We did it!\xfffeThank you, Mr. Pokamon!
Boohoo! Mr. Pokamooon,\xfffeyou shoulda tried hardeeeeer!
I'm four! I'll try hard!\xfffeTrainer, you try hard too!
I'm four! I tried hard!\xfffeTrainer, you were weak!
I'm four! I tried hard!\xfffeTrainer, you tried hard too!
Hoo-loo-lee-laa... Hoo-loo-lee-lalala...\xfffeOn the edges of societyyy...
Hoo-loo-lee-laa, hoo-loo-lee-laa...\xfffeFlowing like the clooouds...
Hoo-loo-lee-laa, hoo-loo-lee-laa...\xfffe'Tiiiil we meet again...
I'm no ordinary backpacker!\xfffeI'm a NEWLYWED backpacker!
My wife and I don't have any savings,\xfffeso we're on a hitchhike-honeymoon!
This trip is our honeymoon!\xfffeBut I got separated from my wife...
I'm on a poor man's trip.\xfffeThis should spice things up!
When you go on a trip,\xfffeyou're limited by wealth and age!
Ooogh... I'm starving...\xfffeSend me a blessing...!
MGHHHHH!! Luggage is HEA-VY!\xfffeWHY IS IT SO HEAVY?!
Really, why is it so heavy?\xfffeDid you put something inside?
MGHHHHH!! The luggage fell down,\xfffeso thanks for the battle!
I'm on a broken-hearted journey,\xfffebut it's been months now...
Doesn't it make sense to heal\xfffea broken heart with a journey?
I've got nowhere to go back to.\xfffeMaybe I should just be a traveler...
Huh? And who're you?\xfffeYou gonna play Pokamon with me?
Y... You're weak!\xfffeOr am I just strong...?
Whoa! You're strong!\xfffeI'm gonna run now!
Gotta take a break sometimes.\xfffeI'm here to relax!
Ah, that put me in a good mood!\xfffeGuess I'll work hard tomorrow!
Ahhh, that should've refreshed me,\xfffebut it seems it was just stressful...
A quiet life of steady work and\xfffesteady income... that's what I want.
Dreams differ, don't they?\xfffeI just want to live normally!
I think I just want happiness\xfffemore than chasing any big dreams...
Hey! Ho there!\xfffeLet's live it up!
So? How 'bout my Pokémon?!\xfffeThey're way fresher than yours!
Thank ya, come again!\xfffeHow were they? Y'know, my Pokémon?!
Didja come ta\xfffedominate in Pokémon battles?
Don't give up if yer scurred!\xfffeTry yer best ta win!
Yerra strong trainer!\xfffeFuhgive me!
Hello, and welcome!\xfffeWhat will your order be?
Here you are! The disgrace\xfffeof a Pokémon battle!
Here you are! The glory\xfffeof a Pokémon battle!
Mew-mew! It's a meowttle!\xfffe(I sound like such an idiot...)
Mewray! Purrfect victory!\xfffe(I hate this job...)
Meowww! I'm a sore mewser!\xfffe(This is doubly embarrassing...)
If you love Pokémon, you can't lose!\xfffeWith love, you can do anything!
This victory is clear proof\xfffeof my love for Pokémon!
With love, I can do anything...\xfffeSo shouldn't I have won with love?
Oh, you want to see\xfffemy spectacular Pokémon, too?
How do you like them Pokémon?!\xfffeSplendid, aren't they?
Waaah!! What in BLAZES?!?\xfffeMy dear Pokémooooon...!
With my honor as head of the\xfffeFan Club... Come, commoner!!
Face defeat at the hands of\xfffethe head of the Pokémon Fan Club!
Ack! Disperse for now!\xfffeYou runt! You'll regret this!!
I love Pokémon so much,\xfffeit's made me lose a lot of things...
I dedicate my life to Pokémon!\xfffeYou weren't nearly as prepared!
I gave it my life, and I didn't win!\xfffeWhat am I supposed to DO?!
Listen, I can't help it if\xfffeI really really really love Pokémon!
If I could be reborn,\xfffeit'd definitely be as a Pokémon!
Your Pokémon are fantastic!\xfffeLET ME TOUCH THEM!!
I'm not particularly good at battling,\xfffebut I'm just serving the Fan Club!
I've protected the honor\xfffeof the Fan Club! Hoohoho!
Long live the Fan Club!!\xfffeThe Fan Club is eternal!!
I should be hiking! How did I\xfffeend up on a train instead? HOW?
Well, either way, this is\xfffean interesting place, yes, yes!
Ah, the mountains...!\xfffeThe mountains beckon, yes, yes!
A "hiker?" How rude!\xfffeCall me an alpinist!
You should call me an alpinist\xfffebecause I'm such a mountain maniac!
A mountain specialist is\xfffean alpinist! Remember it!
I'm a fisherman, so I take my rod\xfffeeverywhere! But it gets in the way!
I didn't need this rod at all\xfffeto win that battle!
Ah, geez, you stupid rod!\xfffeThat's it, I quit! Fishing! Forever!
Hm, I get the feeling\xfffeyou think you're big game!
I was right,\xfffeyou were big game!
Ahhh! That fish I let\xfffeloose was SO HUGE!
A Parasol Lady without a parasol\xfffeis absurdity, so I must have one!
I'm sure people think I'm weird\xfffefor opening an umbrella indoors, but...
My... my parasol! It's broken!\xfffeNow I'm just a plain old LADY!
I'll take my anger over being rejected\xfffeon a rainy day out on you!
The rain falling on me seems to\xfffepierce my already-broken heart...
They say it's an endless rain,\xfffebut isn't it only in my heart?
I've been waiting verrrrry long\xfffefor someone like you!
Huh, not what I was expecting...\xfffeNot interested anymore!
Whatever you are, I think I like you!\xfffeWe should be friends!
Don't slack off, twerp!\xfffeGive it all your guts!
Heh, surprised you lost?!\xfffeYou don't got what it takes!
Geh... I'm still too weak...\xfffeCan't apologize enough, Pokémon...
I'm really clumsy in almost everything,\xfffebut I'm serious about Pokémon!
Having Pokémon with me\xfffemakes me feel calm...
I hope you find something\xfffeyou can be serious about too!
My policy is always\xfffehaving slicked-back hair!
My stylish hair alone\xfffemakes me stronger!
If you want to get even stronger,\xfffeI recommend slicked-back hair!
I came here on my bike!\xfffeHEY! You laughin' at me?!
I'm gonna spend my\xfffewhole life on a bike!
Without my bike, I'd be such\xfffea coward, I wouldn't even go out...
That loud roar you're hearing is\xfffeme aiming for my own goals!
I think I've taken\xfffeanother step toward my goals!
You gotta decide\xfffeyour goals too, OR ELSE!
I'm a biker, but\xfffeI've not yet ridden one.
I'm a biker, but\xfffeI still lack friends.
I'm a biker, but\xfffeI've not yet won.
My Pokémon are healthy as bread!\xfffeThat's what I raised them on!
If you ate my special bread,\xfffeyou'd feel good in a flash too!
You're strong... have you\xfffebeen eating my special bread?
One, two, three, four loaves...\xfffeNope, still missing a loaf...
Ahhh, I'm out a loaf of bread...\xfffeMy husband will scold me...
Oh, curse ye, curse ye...\xfffeWhere did my bread get to...?
Hey, you! Are you eating\xfffebreakfast every day?
I skipped breakfast today,\xfffebut I guess I'm energetic enough!
Always eating breakfast gives you\xfffea healthy first step to the day!
Don't LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!\xfffeI am ON PATROL!
It's DANGEROUS HERE!\xfffeBut ALL TOO MUCH FUN!
You're WORTH LOOKING OUT FOR!\xfffeI'll keep MY EYE ON YOU!
I'm a policeman!\xfffeIn short, I AM THE JUSTICE!!
Justice always wins!\xfffeAND I AM JUSTICE!!
But, but I am a policeman!!\xfffeBut, but I am JUSTICE!!
I don't wanna get any madder...\xfffeMaybe I can dispel my gloom...
Heh heh heh! See that?\xfffeI can do anything here, see?!
Ohhh nooo! What?!\xfffeAm I just useless...? Awww...
I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!\xfffeI'm good if only for m'youth!
Howzat? Hey, howzat?\xfffeAren't I so peppy?!
Ah! I'm cool wit' losing!\xfffeI'm still feeling lively!
I'm trying to rise to the level of a\xfffefamous comedian! Hey, don't laugh yet!
Good sense of humor, am I right?\xfffeWill you come to my shows?
You remind me of my friends\xfffefrom when I was in the dumps...
Er, moi cannot use his tricksy arts,\xfffeso moi shall just fight normally.
Pardon, I am but a clown!\xfffePardon moi for winning normally!
I am but a clown, so it seems my\xfffevictory was never to be... excusez-moi!
Your face is laughing, your heart's crying...\xfffeA once-in-a-lifetime theatric!
You! You're on the wrong script!\xfffeDon't ruin the play!
Waha! Wahaha! It is law\xfffefor even losing clowns to laugh!
YIKES! I came out to play\xfffewhile still in my work uniform!
WHOA! I seriously WON!!\xfffeIn that case, I'm not changing!
HUH?! And I LOST, too?!\xfffeNOTHING'S going right today!
How fashionable...\xfffeAre you showing off to old men?
Middle-aged life is simple...\xfffePart of it is people's adoration, though...
You feel good when you're popular,\xfffebut sometimes it just dies out...
Welcome back, master.\xfffeYou put in a good effort today.
You did well, master,\xfffebut please get some rest...
Ah, excellent, master!\xfffeYou are indeed SUCH a tough one!
I used to be popular once,\xfffebut now I've got nobody...
I hope for an eternity of success...\xfffeWill it come if I put in the effort?
When eras change, victories fade...\xfffeI noticed that too late...
Hohoh! Get out of that pose!\xfffeIf you lose, you'll be my model!
I'll sketch you in regret!\xfffeJust stay still, like that...
Wait! If you were my model,\xfffeI could make a fantastic piece!
Feelings are important to battle!\xfffeI FEEL IT! You feel too!
More! You gotta feel more!\xfffeOr you can't win a battle!
Aaaahn! I FEEL it!!\xfffeI feel your PASSION!
Whenever anybody treasures anyone,\xfffethey grow, if only a little!
I've treasured these guys\xfffesince I was a kid!
Surely you're here because\xfffeyou've treasured someone, too?
Lately, instead of the kids fighting,\xfffeit's been the parents fighting...
What kind of adults will the kids\xfffeof childish adults grow up to be...?
Fights between adults are\xfffemore childish than children's fights...
SQUEEE! You're so CUTE! I wanna take\xfffeyou home and lub you and squeeze you!
You're so CUTE when you lose!\xfffeI wanna go over and comfort you!
Hnnngh! You're ADORABLE!\xfffeI wish I could lub you all I wanted!
We've trained at crime scenes!\xfffeNow to show you our power!
How are they?! My Pokémon!\xfffePowerful strong, aren't they?!
A strange occurrence! Why lose\xfffewhen we're too powerful to lose?
Oh! Y'look lively!\xfffeRighty then! Let's do it!
Ohhh, yes! We did it!\xfffeHow're thems?! Good work, pal!
Ohhh! Good one, young'n!\xfffeY'showed my pal what for!
I'm so lonely... An after-work\xfffePokémon battle is my only joy...
Phaha-HAH!! And this is\xfffewhy I'm never giving up Pokémon!
Oof! You broke my heeeart!\xfffeI'm used to being lonely, I'll deal...
Pokémon is even popular at work!\xfffeI'm clamoring for it!
For something I do in between work,\xfffeI didn't do bad, eh?
Can old men and runts\xfffeenjoy Pokémon just as much...?
BOTH MY LEGS FEEL BROKEN\xfffeTHE MARK OF A TRUE CYCLIST
MY POKéMON ARE TRAINED ON CYCLING\xfffeTHEY'D NEVER LOSE TO YOU
MY CYCLING GOES ON FOREVER\xfffeMAY I CHALLENGE YOU ANOTHER TIME
Not good... how did she lead me here?\xfffeI must've been too in love!
Like a saddle over my cold body...\xfffeShe's the ultimate lover!
I stumbled over myself and lost...\xfffeWell, whatever, I have her!
Your fun is already at its end!\xfffeIt'll be time to wake up soon!
The end is always sudden,\xfffeand always seems too soon!
Thinking of everything being\xfffeall a dream is a big mistake!
NO good! I am NOT satisfied!\xfffeI do NOT have enough bikes!
I can't be satisfied with my bikes!\xfffeThat's just part of being a biker!
MORE!! I want speed that\xfffecan't be beat by NOBODYYYYY!
Don't even think I would\xfffeyield to a youngster like you!
I'm not losing to youngsters yet!\xfffeMy life'll keep roaring on!
Bra-VO! I gotta admit, I've seen\xfffesome skilled youngsters lately!
I'll scrub you like cleaning products\xfffescrub away tough stains instantly!
And I'm the victor,\xfffeshiny as a polished tile!!
And I'm as worn out\xfffeas an old dust cloth...
I LIKE TRAINS I LIKE TRAINS\xfffeI LIKE TRAINS SO DUH I WORK HERE
WORKING WITH WHAT YOU LIKE\xfffeMAKES YOU HAPPY EVERY DAY
I THINK I LIKE TRAINS TOO MUCH\xfffeIT MAY BE A DISEASE
Your journey ends here!\xfffeI'm your last stop!
I admire you from coming this far,\xfffebut now it's time to get off!
Ahhh... how could this...?\xfffeI need to make a stopover...
I have my honor,\xfffeso I will never lose to a child!
Immature? Adults make sure\xfffethings go their way so they win!
My reputation... my pride...\xfffeI can't be seen like this!
Ho, you there! Let me show you\xfffemy old man technique!
My young daughter dislikes it,\xfffebut old men must try too!
That zealous technique...\xfffeNo way! Are you an old man, too?
A company with healthy women\xfffeis a good company!
I'm always working hard!!\xfffeI can battle anytime, 24/7!
Yiiiiikes! It's that late already?!\xfffeI gotta get back to work!
I'm REALLY irritated!! I'm gonna\xfffelet out stress on some peons!
Thanks for facing me!\xfffeAh, I feel great now!
It's best for the company to decide!\xfffeNot just my superiors!
Er, you're the next patient?\xfffeThen quickly, come here!
Hm! You and your Pokémon\xfffewere calmed down and saved!
Wait! Wait, you!\xfffeI haven't started the operation!
IF THERE'S A PATIENT I COME RUNNING\xfffeAFTER ALL THAT'S MY JOB
YOU SHOULD BE RELIEVED\xfffeTHAT THERE ARE DOCTORS HERE
WHEN I'M WOUNDED, TOO...\xfffeSO I'M ALWAYS RUNNING
I'm bummed when I get the night shift...\xfffeI'd be glad if you went easy on me!
After a rough day at work,\xfffePokémon battles are refreshing!
Yaaawn... so sleepy...\xfffeI think that's enough for today, me...
Are you and your Pokémon\xfffefeeling energetic enough?!
I injected some of\xfffemy energy into you!
If people are energetic,\xfffethey can do anything!
It's unbefitting of a gentleman to\xfffetake too much delight in a battle.
It's unbefitting of a gentleman to\xfffedwell too much on victory.
It's unbefitting of a gentleman to\xfffebe distraught by a battle's result.
Allow me to evaluate\xfffeyour ability!
Yes... your trainer type\xfffemust surely be Kindergartener...
Hm... is your trainer type\xfffethat of a Pokémon Fan Clubber...?
How about trying an elderly lady?\xfffeMy Pokémon are VERY juicy!
Oho... were you done in\xfffeby my sweet, aged poison?
Are a weak woman's Pokémon\xfffelittle more than a snack for you?
Oh-hoh-hoh! I ask you for an\xfffeelegant battle for me to win uniquely!
Oh-hoh-hoh! I had no confidence, yet...\xfffeYou have supplied me with joy!
GRRRGHHH! I SHANT forget this!
Meek, egotistical...\xfffeEven Pokémon have personalities!
You may have lost, but you can't\xfffeget too mad at your Pokémon for it!
It's important to train Pokémon\xfffeconsidering their personalities...
Do you train Pokémon?\xfffeDon't just spoil them!
If even your adorable and beloved\xfffePokémon do wrong, it can't go ignored!
Heaping praise is no good\xfffefor Pokémon and people both...
Pokémon never betray you!\xfffeThey return the love you offer!
This is proof that my love\xfffereaches my Pokémon!
I'd like to show love\xfffeto people too, though...
Let me tell you what it takes\xfffeto train good Pokémon!
Training good Pokémon takes\xfffecatching good Pokémon!
Training good Pokémon takes...\xfffeWell, you don't need to know, huh?
You came! But you won't get any\xfffefurther with your usual methods!
Ha-HAH! See that!\xfffeYou're not ready yet!
Such force you carried...\xfffeWhat ARE your usual methods?
MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE ACES\xfffeSO PERHAPS I TOO AM AN ACE
MY OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME\xfffeAN ACE ALIKE MOTHER AND FATHER
THE GENES OF ACES SHOULD\xfffeHAVE ASSISTED ME DOT DOT DOT
Whatever I try, it's alright!\xfffeEven if I lose, I don't care!
Whoaaa! See?\xfffeYou lost 'cause you didn't concentrate...
Whoaaa! Alright! It's over!\xfffeSo stop staring at me!
Daddy... mommy...\xfffeI'm gonna do it, so watch...
Daddy... mommy... did you see?\xfffeI did it... I did it...!
Daddy... mommy...\xfffeWhat should I do...?
I WAS TIRED OF STUDYING FOR\xfffeEXAMS, SO I RAN AWAY HERE...
I WILL NOT LOSE...\xfffeI DON'T WANT TO STUDY ANYMORE...
NO! I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK!\xfffeI DO NOT WANT TO STUDY!
Future prospects? Getting successful!\xfffeI want to be a billionaire!
By the way, that's my dream!\xfffeTo be a billionaire!
When I become a billionaire,\xfffeI'll be sure to pay you back!
Who and what are you? From where?\xfffeDoes it really matter?
How should we be together?\xfffeIsn't that all that's important?
You're not defined by your label?\xfffeSo ultimately, you're just you?
Pokémon is just like studying!\xfffeYou have to be logical!
You're not efficient enough!\xfffeYou need to work smarter!
Why did I lose to someone\xfffeso careless?! I don't believe it!
I'm filthy stinking rich,\xfffeso I don't want much in particular...
I don't get to have much fun\xfffeoutside of Pokémon battles, though...
I'm rich, so who cares?\xfffeIt wouldn't've made me that happy...
Yes! I am Rich Boy!
Okay! Good bye!\xfffeI was Rich Boy!
Thank you! Arigato!\xfffeI was Rich Boy!
I only enjoy it as a hobby,\xfffebut I shall do my best!
Ah, it happens every so often.\xfffeDon't get too worked up about it.
As I'm playing games, a passing\xfffepetal acts unexpectedly... not bad...
Party yesterday, Pokémon today!\xfffeThat's the lifestyle of the rich!
I don't even need to work!\xfffeBecause I'm RICH!
All play and no work is no good\xfffeOf course I know that!
I pride myself on my Pokémon!!\xfffeGO! All units, ATTACK!
My Pokémon are UNSTOPPABLE!\xfffeOur names will go down in history!
Don't cry... put up with it...\xfffe'Cause we'll win someday!
I came here to fill in for my\xfffebig brother who won't go outside!
I worked hard in place of my\xfffebig brother who won't go outside!
I'd like it if my brother could\xfffecome out of his room and play...
HEYYY there, trainah!\xfffeLez get BATTLIN' an'... an' snruff...!
Man, Pekémon's so FUN!\xfffeTrainer, work on yer... yer... snrk...
Aah couldn't care iffah lose...\xfffeTrainer, yer one heckuva... hrp!
My dad and mom just stare at their\xfffecomputers and tweet! So boring!
I hate dad, mom, and computers!\xfffeI just like Pokémon!
I'd like it better if they talked to me\xfffeinstead of tweeting on the computer...
Youths just wander the world...\xfffeI'm a bona-fide adventurer!
The goal of my journey is\xfffeto see the Pokémon of the world!
Adventure calls!\xfffeWell, so long! 'Til we meet again!
Well, it can't always be easy...\xfffeIn life, or in Pokémon!
Being reckless is acceptable,\xfffebut you need to have some restraint!
Ah, I'll be fine, I'll be fine...\xfffeThere's always a next time...
I search far and wide for my darlin'!\xfffeOut there or not, I journey on!
If you're rich, wealthy, affluent,\xfffeor anything like that, tell me!
The goal is a winding road...\xfffeBut is this truly utopia?
Games are life,\xfffebut life isn't a game!
I'm always serious! I can't win\xfffeif I'm treating things like a game!
Toss your games and set out!\xfffeIt's better for you!
I want to live doing what I like.\xfffeSo I'm fine working part-time forever!
You only live once!\xfffeAre you doing what you want?
I wish I could play here without\xfffebeing bound to tedious work...
I now start my work with the hope\xfffeof seeing people's smiles!
Don't LOOK at me like that!\xfffeTurn that frown upside down!
I'm distraught, but I think your smile\xfffehas made it all worth it...
We're ready! Quickly, we begin!\xfffeWe're RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
Huhhh? It's over already?\xfffeBut we still have plenty of time!
Wait, it's time already?\xfffeYou can't give an extension?!
I battle here as part of\xfffemy business at the shop!
You're not all that strong...\xfffeMy shop isn't really aimed at you.
Yeee! What a strong trainer!\xfffeTeehee... See you at the shop, I hope?
Go on, join the Fan Club!\xfffeYour life will be made HAPPY!
If you join the Fan Club,\xfffeyou'll be strong like me!
Joining the Fan Club\xfffewill save your LIFE!
I'm not in the Pokémon Fan Club...\xfffeI'm in the Pokémon LOVE Club!
I love Pokémon so much!\xfffeI LOVE loving Pokémon!
Remember this!\xfffeRemember I'm in the Pokémon Love Club!
We have our reasons for being fans.\xfffeNamely, we have reasons to love.
Love makes one powerful.
You ought to remember...\xfffeWe are love.
Some people are young and beautiful,\xfffebut youth isn't beauty!
Although when I was young,\xfffeI didn't have the troubles I do now...
Youth will be youth!\xfffeWe have to realize that...
Hoh! So you are the mountain\xfffestanding in my way!
YAHOOOOO!! YAHOOOOO!!\xfffeLet my cry of victory echo!
Oogh... my victory went\xfffeflying off into a crevasse...
Hiii! Kept - me - WAIT-ING!\xfffeI'm a hiker aiming to be a pop idol!
Oooh? Done already?\xfffeHiker says BO-RING!!
Here's something important! Remember it!\xfffePeople aren't as they seem!
As you can see, I'm a boss.\xfffeIt's a secret to everybody, alright?
It'd be bad news if word got out\xfffethat I was playing games here!
A boss doesn't have any freedom.\xfffeJust like a caught Pokémon...
I really wish I could live my\xfffewhole life peacefully fishing...
Ah, all I want to do is fish!\xfffeWinning and losing makes me tired...
Around my age, you pretty much\xfffestop caring when you lose...
*click*! Hello? I'm... uh? NOW?\xfffeYou want to battle NOW?
Hey? Hello? Can you hear me?\xfffeI SAID, I just WON the BATTLE!
Um, hello? Can you hear me?\xfffeUm... listen... I looost...
He said he wanted to "score"\xfffewith me... um, what's that mean?
W-W-W-Waaaagh! WAAAAAGH!!\xfffeI'm crying tears of joy, here!!
W-W-W-Waaaagh! WAAAAAGH!!\xfffeWAAAAAGH!! WAAAAAGH!!
No need to talk to an opponent\xfffeyou're about to beat, am I right?
When you lose, you lose in real life!\xfffeSo I stand firm!
Don't look at me!\xfffeGo on, get out of here!
You have your path!\xfffeI have I's path!
I go on I's path!\xfffeThat's the only path for me!
Your path is too high up for me!\xfffeI'll give you bedrock support!
Hoo-yah! Mess with the bad,\xfffeand your Pokémon get... sad!
I thought you'd be a bigger deal,\xfffebut your attacks were wack!
Them's some sweet moves!\xfffeNo wonder I got SQUAAASHED!
My mom and dad are Veterans,\xfffebut I'm just... there...
Are mom and dad disappointed\xfffewhen they look at me, the Cue Ball...?
If I can't be like my mom and dad,\xfffeI just have to live as a Cue Ball!
I'm partners with my\xfffestardust pal's Pokémon!
Hey, see me? Pal...\xfffeWe're good friends now...
When people go into the sky,\xfffethey become stardust... right, pal...?
I don't like talking at all...\xfffeI'll let my bike speak instead...
Vrooooom! Vroom VROOM!!\xfffeVrrrrrooooom! VRRRRRRRRRR!
Sputter!! Sponk, spittle!!\xfffeSkreeeee!! PLUNK!!
Pardon me... you prepared?\xfffeDon't mess with a biker!
A biker's speed ain't the\xfffeonly thing to worry about!!
We're actually really honest!\xfffeWe haven't done anything bad!
My Pokémon are as tenacious\xfffeas fermented bread!
Now you know how tenacious\xfffemy Pokémon are, don'tcha?
Hey, your Pokémon are made out of\xfffesome pretty perseverant stuff too, huh?
I'll bake your Pokémon\xfffelike I bake my bread!
My, my! Your Pokémon\xfffelook like burnt bread!
Well, burn my bread! Sheesh!\xfffeMy hopes got burnt black...
Just like I knead bread,\xfffeI'll see if I can knead you!
Want to be kneaded more?\xfffeOr should I make you a sandwich?
Gwaaaaargh! Remember this!\xfffeI'll sandwich you in someday!
Laughing makes you healthy!\xfffeThat's so... scientific!
AHAHAHA! Hm?\xfffeWhat's wrong? Laugh it up!
Haha! I lost to you! You can laugh\xfffeat me, it'll make you feel good!
YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME?\xfffeARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN\xfffeON A CLOWN...
A MOST UNBELIEVABLE EVENT...\xfffeYOU ARE CLEARLY NOT ORDINARY
My Pokémon juggling is the BEST!\xfffeTake a goooood look!
The things I juggle are\xfffemore than meets the eye!
Balls to juggle and food...\xfffeThose are a clown's assets.
NO SMALL TALK...\xfffeONLY DESTRUCTION...
HUH... BROKEN ALREADY...
GEE-HEEHEEHEE...
I don't have any self-confidence...\xfffeSo I like people ordering me around...
You're couldn't be my Master...\xfffeI guess there's no helping weakness...
Would you be alright with it\xfffeif I were to call you my Master?
This isn't my uniform! I sewed\xfffethese clothes myself! It's a hobby!
It's a uniform like in my animes!\xfffeCute, huh? Looks good on me?
I wish I could live in a game,\xfffeor an anime, or a manga, or a...
I'm not fit for a normal job,\xfffeso art puts food on the table...
Pokémon are so at ease.\xfffeI wish I could be a Pokémon...
If I could do a normal job,\xfffeI would just give up the arts...
Every time my Pokémon use a move!\xfffeMy heart shudders a little!
Nothing shakes the soul\xfffequite like a Pokémon move!
HAHHHHH! Your Pokémon's moves are\xfffebeautiful enough to make me swoon...
Don't know what it means to give up?\xfffeThen here's a present of sorrow!
Sending people into deep depression...\xfffeThis too is art!
At last you know...\xfffeBoth defeat and sorrowful victory!
My job involves heavy physical labor,\xfffeand honestly, it's rough!
It's 'cause of my job\xfffethat I'm this buff!
This is the strength of a little kid...\xfffeWell, I sure won't make light of you!
Raising children that raise\xfffePokémon is a real burden!
Giving it my all like this makes me\xfffeforget my endless hardships!
So I'm the trainer\xfffethat's sprinkled with salt...
Hey! You there!\xfffeBig sis'll raise you real nice!
Teehee... Now big sis'll\xffferaise you reeeeeal nice...
As an adult, sometimes I have\xfffea desire to raise a child!
The scene of the crime is danger-esque,\xfffebut Pokémon must do their best now!
Training Pokémon here, then\xfffeit's the crime scene a-go-go!
Hawawa! So wounded! I can't\xfffemake money money tomorrow!
WELCOME!!
I won the battle!!\xfffeThankya for the JOY!!
Alright, uh... that works...
Working the same simple work daily...\xfffeAm I a cog in the corporate machine?
I'm all worn smooth...\xfffeI can't mesh with anything...
I'm just happy that I'm\xfffenot a cog in society...
Yo! Shorty! You a newbie?\xfffeI'm a gossiping worker!
You ain't qualified if you don't know me!\xfffeSmell ya later! Worker out!
I'll remember ya, shorty!\xfffeI'm a gossiping worker!
Well, shall we do introductions?\xfffeThese are my honeys!
So? What of my honeys?\xfffeTough? Victorious? Cutey-pies?
WHOO! Your honeys\xfffeare stylish too, aren't they?!
Pedal-pedal-pedal-pedal...
Ring! Ringading-ding!
SCREEEEECH!!
Oh, this? It's just a limited-production,\xfffetop-model bicycle, nothing special!
Having good tools accentuates\xfffeyour own greatness!
Stooop! Don't touch my bicycle!\xfffeYour fingerprints will dirty it!
Speed is a vital part of battle!\xfffeDASH! DASH! DAAASH!
If this were a race,\xfffewould I be at the finish line?
I can't even associate with you!\xfffeI'm going back to my mom's house!
Ah, you there!\xfffeShow me all your Pokémon!
Hm? That's all your Pokémon?\xfffeYou aren't hiding any others?
Hmm, I don't see anything suspicious\xfffeabout you or your Pokémon!
I protect my peace.
I protected my peace.
Don't disrupt my peace.
I was born to work.\xfffeThat is my fate!
I work, work, work, and work!\xfffeThat's the only time I'm happy!
Even when I'm battling like this,\xfffeit's really part of my work!
Right now I'm a shabby subordinate,\xfffebut someday I'll be at the tip-top!
I'm looking to be the shining star\xfffeof the business world!
Your talent rivals the stars!\xfffeDon't lose, don't lose, don't lose!
I have AMBITIONS!\xfffeThat is why I joined my company!
Everything goes toward my ambitions!\xfffeThis victory is just one small step!
I am obsessed with my ambitions!\xfffeMy glimmering, shining ambitions!
I'm an idol at the office!\xfffeEveryone pampers me!
Everyone does my work for me!\xfffeI don't have to do anything!
I actually hate brushing my teeth\xfffeand bathing... keep it secret?
Well, don't you look proud...\xfffeI'll scrub you!!
Yes, yes! I think things look\xfffea little bit cleaner around here!
GRAAAH! You won't escape!\xfffeI still need to scrub you more!
A stubborn old man is the result\xfffeof stubborn people's stubborn raising!
Raising a stubborn old man is\xfffedifferent from being fussy about youth...
There's a fine line between stubborn\xfffeand fussy... am I on it...?
I AM SKILLED AT DRIVING\xfffeBUT BAD AT CONTROLLING POKéMON
THAT WENT SURPRISINGLY WELL\xfffeMAYBE I'M ACTUALLY A TECHNICIAN?
GETTING POKéMON TO LISTEN\xfffeTO YOU IS DIFFICULT
I've never left here once,\xfffenot since I was born!
And I'll keep\xfffebeing here, too...
How long will I be here?\xfffeWhat's the outside world like?
Let me speak as a doctor...\xfffeFirstly, treasure your money!
Money can't buy health, but\xfffeyou can't be healthy if you're poor!
Without money, you can't eat,\xfffeor even go to the hospital...
As you can see, I'm a doctor.\xfffeBut I haven't actually practiced yet...
I tried becoming a doctor,\xfffebut I faint at the sight of blood...
I've got no experience...\xfffeI'm a doctor in name alone!
You know people to administer medical\xfffetreatment are a necessity, don't you?
Physicians need love!\xfffePlentiful, unconditional love!
Medical treatment is practically love.\xfffeWould you be a doctor, too?
I chose my profession because\xfffeI wanted somebody to rely on me!
My work is difficult, but it\xfffemakes me happy to know I help!
I'm glad to get my patients out of\xfffethe hospital, but a little sad, too...
Adults have a WIDE variety of interests!\xfffeFor example, I'm nuts about uniforms!
I'm not actually a nurse...\xfffeBut this is what I always wear!
Sorry for being a fake nurse!\xfffeDon't mind me, I'm just nuts!
Even if we're hurt, I can fix it,\xfffeso let's fight our best!
Sooorry! I went a little too far...\xfffeNeed to go to the emergency room?
I think you went a BIT too far!\xfffeI'm going to have to bill you!
These are very special Pokémon\xfffetrained by very secret methods!
Pokémon are weak or strong\xfffeall depending on how they're trained!
Hmm... this shouldn't have...\xfffeDid I mix extracts incorrectly?
Shall I tell you how to\xffferaise super-effective Pokémon?
Buy my book on Pokémon raising\xfffeand you'll be set!
Buy my DVD on Pokémon raising\xfffeand you'll be unstoppable!
Pokémon are my FAMILY!!\xfffeWe'll show you our family's unity!
We did it, brother! We did it, sister!\xfffeA family together is undefeatable!
Nooo! My FAMILY!!\xfffeWhat have you DONE?!?
Do your preferences and your\xfffeskills differ? It doesn't matter!
I'm skilled at battling,\xfffebut I don't like it that much...
I work according to my skills,\xfffeand that's enough for me!
As a general statement,\xfffeyou AIN'T beatin' me, pal!
See? No way you'd win!\xfffeWhacked 'cause you're WEAK!
Hmm, pretty good?\xfffeDare I say you're pretty good?
Look down on me as an old fogey,\xfffeand I'll give you an vigorous blow!
Age brings you popularity!\xfffeNursing home? No thank you!
How brutal you are\xfffeto a helpless old man...!
I want to retire soon,\xfffeyet I have no heir...
If only I had a child like you,\xfffeold age would bring me no worry...
If only my son would be\xfffeas reliable as you...
It depresses me to look at\xfffesuch a glimmering youth as you...
The sparkle of youth...\xfffeHow radiant it is to me now...
The gleam in your eyes...\xfffeNo, there's no going back...
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeIt's the world's greatest pilot!
How's that! Flying colors!!
And who are YOU?!\xfffeSomebody who made me ANGRY!!
FIRST!\xfffeMen always aim for first!
Remember me, will you?\xfffeThe one whose favorite word was FIRST!
You didn't do too shabby!\xfffeSee you! Remember me!
Never beat! No retreat! No defeat!\xfffeBusinessmen never lose!
HOOOOO!
Nnnngh... not bad...\xfffeI shouldn't be on MY knees...
I can DO IT! I can do ANYTHING!\xfffeLet's do this! Let's DO THIS!!
We did it! We DID IT! I can do it!\xfffeI can DO IT! I CAN DOOOOO IT!!
My teacher told me a good story!\xfffeI shouldn't lose, I SHOULDN'T lose!
MY RESEARCH SHALL BRING PEACE\xfffeAND HAPPINESS TO THE WORLD
GENIUS THAT I AM,\xfffeI SHALL SHAPE THE FUTURE!
I AM A GENIUS...\xfffeHOW COULD I LOSE TO SUCH A FOE...
My life is nothing but research.\xfffeI've left my family, too!
There's nothing wrong with giving\xfffeyour life for research, right?
Devotion to some things\xfffesometimes leads to loneliness...
Fyahaha...\xfffeHelp me out with an experiment!
Fyahaha... Success!\xfffeThe experiment was a huge success!
Ohyohyo... This won't work...\xfffeThe experiment was a failure...
Go on, face my\xfffescience-powered Pokémon!
Ah, a typical result...\xfffeThe power of science is superlative!
Dare I say your Pokémon possess\xfffea power more awesome than science!
If you lose, I'll be able to test this\xfffenewly-developed medicine on you!
Hooheehee... You lost!\xfffeNow, drink this medicine!
Bah! I nearly had a perfect\xfffetest subject in my grasp...
Why do people fight?\xfffeThat's the theme of my research!
Even when you win,\xfffeyour foe's feelings are wounded...
When you lose, you have\xfffea grudge against your foe...
HELLO!! Let us CONCENTRATE!!
FWOOOOOAAAAA!!
FGYAAAAAHHHHH!!
Fighting with pretty words and wit\xfffedisgraces the art of battle...
Fighting as a sport\xfffebrings out a trainer's best...
Loss has not a speck of worth.\xfffeA loser need not speak...
Ehee! Eheehee! If you lose,\xfffeI'll turn you into a Pokémon!
Ehee! Eheehee!\xfffeYou're already a Pokémon!
When we next meet, my powers\xfffemay have turned me into a Pokémon...
Oogh... my head hurts....\xfffeMy head huuuuurts...
I don't need psychic powers...\xfffeSomebody just stop the headaches...
I have to use my power in battle,\xfffeor the headaches get even worse...
People call me a psychic,\xfffebut I can't use any powers...
Following psychic fashion\xfffemakes me look mystical, though!
To seem more like a psychic,\xfffeI take classes in magic!
...Mumble, hmph... YAAAAH!!\xfffeIt's an evil spirit! HAVE AT YOU!
Yesss! The evil spirit\xfffevanished before my might!
Grrr! Cursed evil spirit!!\xfffeGet out of that trainer this instant!
You must be confident to challenge\xfffeme and my Milky Way Kick!
Haha... I didn't even have to\xfffeuse my Milky Way Kick!
Ah... only my Pokémon were fighting.\xfffeMy kick had nothing to do with it...
Yesss! Let's fight intenselys!\xfffeThanks you in advances!!
YESSS! It's overs!\xfffeBe carefuls with your lifes!
YESSS! Well dones!\xfffeBut I have so much regrets!
Teeeeess!
Tess! Tess! Tess!
Tess!
I won't put on any appearances...\xfffeI'll be fine if I lose...
Now then, fall asleep\xfffepeacefully in my arms...
Saying goodbye is painful,\xfffebut there's no time left...
So, are you ready to battle?\xfffeI've got a book in hand!
Yeesh, that doesn't make a good story.\xfffeIt's just bullying a weakling!
Ahhh! I'm shot down!\xfffeWhat ARE you?!
If I could, I'd prefer to fight\xfffein place of my Pokémon...
Unsatisfactory! I wanted to be\xfffethe one to beat the stuffing out of you!
Ahh, my blood is boiling...\xfffeI wanna fight, too...
Ah, wait! Trainer, there!\xfffeThou battlest I!
Ah! I've struck thou down!
Aiyaaa! Wait!\xfffeForgive me! Thou, forgiveth me!
When living surrounded by nature,\xfffemany things become insignificant...
Even my victory would mean\xfffelittle if I lived with Mother Nature...
Even my loss would mean\xfffelittle to Mother Nature...
As you can see, I'm a city boy!\xfffeAnd I yearn for rural life...
What's your hometown?\xfffeShow your face 'round there sometime...
I was born and raised in the city.\xfffeI wanna hometown to go back to...
It is my mission to protect\xfffethe Pokémon who live in nature!
If there's a villain who would\xfffedisturb nature, I'll show them what for!
Treasure nature!\xfffeOr I'll beat you up!
PROTECTING NATURE AND POKéMON\xfffeREQUIRES LOTS OF MONEY
PLEASE DONATE MONEY TOWARD\xfffeNATURE AND POKéMON PROTECTION
MONEY GOES TO PLANTING TREES\xfffeAND PROTECTING POKéMON
Ho! Let me stop you in your tracks!\xfffeGet it? Tracks?
Not good enough!\xfffeRun home and train summore, eh?
This isn't just 'cause of you...\xfffeIt's 'cause of your Pokémon!
You look so full of yourself!\xfffeLet me rain on your parade!
I put my very soul\xfffeinto my Pokémon battles!
WAAAUGH! AAAHHHHH!!\xfffeI won't do it anymore! I'M SORRYYYYY!
Just hollerin' your head off\xfffeain't strength at all!
Either I'mma strong trainer,\xfffeor I'm just real lucky!
What?! So even a battlin' genius\xfffelike myself can lose?!
All I wanted was to be popular,\xfffebut I ended up becoming an Ace!
You can get strong with a goal in mind!\xfffeThat's how it goes for everyone, right?
Although people see me as an ace,\xfffeI'm still not very popular...
Who's the protagonist of this story...?\xfffeSeriously, somebody tell me!
The protagonist is ME!\xfffeYou're just a supporting character!
Aha! Naturally, it would be you!
I ONLY WANT TO USE\xfffePOWERFUL POKéMON
AND I WAS JUST PLAYING!\xfffeNOW OUT OF MY SIGHT!
HO HO HO! YOU ARE NOT BAD!\xfffeI AM RATHER PLEASED!
Fight, fight, fight for all etenity...\xfffeThat's an Ace for you!
No number of battles is enough!\xfffeIsn't that the mark of a true trainer?
I'm familiar with your fighting form...\xfffeYou could be an Ace Trainer, too!
I see despair in your eyes!\xfffeNow, have at you!
Just a waste of time after all...\xfffeTrain again from the start!
...Because I underestimated you?\xfffe...Or because of your sheer ability?
Hey, shorty trainer!\xfffeAren't I such a dandy?
As a dandy, I must say\xfffethat I was stunning...
Grief ruins my face...\xfffeMaybe I'm too much of a dandy...
Don't know the do-re-mi's of battle,\xfffeand you'll get beat like a brat!
Beating amateurs is just too easy!\xfffe(W-whoa... t-that was a close one...)
Huh? It's not "do-re-mi's," it's "ABC's"?\xfffeHa, haha... I knew that!
Ooh! Cough, cough, I feel awful!\xfffePlease have pity on me!
My feeling awful was a LIE!\xfffeA Veteran has crafty techniques!
You're pretty sharp for seeing\xfffethrough my cunning ruse...
As a Veteran, I'll show you\xfffea feast of flavorful Pokémon!
How were my veteran Pokémon?\xfffeBittersweet, aren't they?
Defeat is the spice of life\xfffeburning my tongue...
Oh my, you're simply adorable!\xfffeCome here, I'll be gentle!
Oh, truly delectable...\xfffeI'll be waiting for your return!
You're delightful in battle, as well!\xfffeMay you play with me again!
Huh? Aren't you still just a kid?\xfffeMaybe come back when you're older?
No offense, but you SUCK!\xfffeGet in some more experience!
And I thought you were just a kid...\xfffeHeehee... you're pretty strong...
Stop calling me a "veteran"!\xfffeA woman's heart is always in bloom!
All's fair in love and Pokémon!\xfffeYou need to suffer a casualty first!
My eyes, shoulders, and hips all hurt,\xfffebut my heart is eternally Lass!
I am the ULTIMATE BACKPACKER!\xfffeLookit the Pokémon I've got in here!
HAHAHA! I'm just as big of a deal\xfffeas the bag on my back is big!
I still have Pokémon in this bag!\xfffe...But there's a HOLE in it!
Wanting to be free wasn't really\xfffemy reason for setting out!
I carry a lot of luggage,\xfffebut do I really need all this?
My bag is filled with sky...\xfffeThat is, it's empty!
I haven't had a bite in days...\xfffeYou're looking pretty tasty...
Ahhh, I can't help myself!\xfffeCan I nibble on you a little...?
Ahhh, no more! You and your\xfffePokémon are looking like feasts...
My husband and I are penniless,\xfffeso we're on a hitchhike honeymoon...
A trip like this for newlyweds...\xfffeI worry a bit for our future...
I got separated from my husband...\xfffeWhere's he off loitering now?
Excuse me! Excuse me, customer!\xfffeI've got a good kid! Look at him!
SOOO, customer?!\xfffeThat's my honor student Pokémon!
Excuse me, customer?!\xfffePLEASE don't hurt my kid!
Being a waiter is a way\xfffeto hide yourself from the world!
On my off days,\xfffeI'm actually an Ace Trainer!
Daily life is hard...\xfffeSo I'm always hiding myself...
My Pokémon are the BESTEST!\xfffeI ain't gonna lose ta you!
You think ya can beat me\xfffewith them pansy Pokémon?
Ahhh! That was crazy!\xfffeLosin' sucks, mate!
Don't you think a restaurant\xfffefor Pokémon would be fun?
Wouldn't everyone delight in\xfffea full course for Pokémon?
A restaurant FOR Pokémon!\xfffeNOT a Pokémon restaurant!
PAGOOO!! PAGOOO!!
PAGOOO!!
PAGORAAAAAHHH!!
I'm your life's greatest mountain!\xfffeClimb me, you can climb 'em all!
Haha! The road over me\xfffeis a long way off for you!
The top at last!\xfffeYes, this is my summit!
Lose, and I'll tell you fishing's basics.\xfffeWin, and know fishing's essence!
The basics of fishing...?\xfffeJust wait without nodding off!
The essence of fishing\xfffeis simply to pull hard! PULL!!
I'm always going for the big fish!\xfffeIf you're just small fry, swim off!
Well, good attempt!\xfffe'Twas a nice fight!
Whoa! Talk about a biggun!\xfffeMy hands and my heart are shaking!
Hm, you seem pretty mature...\xfffeI like kids like you!
Still, undoubtedly mature!\xfffeHeck, are you an adult already?
Men with the hearts of boys\xfffeare such spoiled brats!
How much was this umbrella, you ask?\xfffeIt's just some cheap, disposable thing!
Sure, I'm a Parasol Lady, but\xfffeI don't put all my money into them!
Umbrellas are just ordinary, aren't they?\xfffeBut they're good in the rain!
With Pokémon, nobody'll\xfffetalk smack to you!
Somebody gets mad anywhere,\xfffePokémon are the best for it!
Yer a good brawler too!\xfffeI like ya! Good trainer! Best friend!
If my online friends knew I looked\xfffelike this, they wouldn't mess with me!
I won, but that was scary as heck...\xfffeThis place really isn't "for" me...
Eeeee... I ought to just\xfffestay in my room on the PC...
I'm always with this machine!\xfffeAnytime, anywhere!
I need this machine\xfffeso I can be like me!
My motorcycle supports me\xfffewhen I'm forlorn with loss...
I don't have money for gas!\xfffeGotta walk it along myself...
A biker will keep on, even with\xfffea bike that doesn't work...
Nooo! Mommyyy! Daddyyy!\xfffeBeing a biker's rough...
Ahhh, I'm so hungry...\xfffeI can't show off... what to do?
I want all-I-can-eat bread,\xfffeso I work at a bakery!
Ahhh! I'm out of calories!\xfffeSomebody give me calories!
ALRIGHT!! Let's DO IT!!\xfffeI am SO PUMPED!!
BAAANG!!
I'LL REMEMBER THIS!!
I'll lose you in my beautiful steps!\xfffeAh! Ho! Ho! Hoooh!
I'm so entranced by my own steps\xfffethat I can't concentrate!
Ho! Ho! Ah! Augh!\xfffeGYAAAAAGH!!
Sorry to keep you waiting!\xfffeI'm everyone's idol, Clown Clown!
Thank you verrrrry much!\xfffeClown Clown has left the building!
This was Clown Clown!\xfffeThanks for all your support!
Okay! If you lose,\xfffeyou must become my maid!
Okay! At least for the moment,\xfffeI shall be your master!
I'll make my maid someday,\xfffeI swear upon it...
Aw... geez... this is weird...\xfffeI feel sooo tired...
Man, I feel so sluggish...\xfffeMy body's all dilly-dallying...
Aw... I've got no chance...\xfffeI gotta get back home...
A CHILD LIKE YOU COULD NOT\xfffeUNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY I SEEK.
A SLAVE TO BEAUTY LIKE MYSELF\xfffeIS NOT FIT FOR DEFEAT.
ARE YOU THE TRUE FORM OF\xfffeTHE BEAUTY I SEEK TO ATTAIN?!
I'm enjoying the years I have left\xfffepainting what I like with Pokémon!
As years go on, hurtful feelings\xfffeget replaced with good memories...
Deal with your troubles in youth!\xfffeWhen you're old, your body can't handle it...
While the kids are having\xfffeafternoon naps, I aim for the top!
Oh, geez!\xfffeThis late already?!
It's snacktime after naptime!\xfffeGotta get back to the daycare!
Goodbyes are just part of life!\xfffeSo enjoy the moment!
We might never meet again,\xfffeso you should give your best!
This is the path of a woman!\xfffeWould a greenhorn like you understand?
Keep pushing with your all!\xfffeMaybe it'll turn out well for you!
You need to keep at it!\xfffeCome on, that's just basic!
Well, even if you try hard,\xfffesometimes it just can't be done...
I'VE COME FROM A DISTANT ISLAND\xfffePLEASE BE MY OPPONENT
I HAVE WON
I WAS INEXPERIENCED\xfffeSHALL I BE YOUR PUPIL?
I'm so obsessed with Pokémon, She\xfffeWho Must Be Obeyed is getting furious...
Pokémon is just so fun!\xfffeWhy would I stop?
I don't wanna go home... I'm really not\xfffelooking forward to Her Majesty's lecture...
On ordinary, sluggish days...\xfffeI never fail to fight Pokémon!
Pokémon alone save me\xfffefrom the tedium of my days...
Just looking at your radiance\xfffemakes my sluggishness melt away...
Ah, I had such hopes and dreams\xfffewhen I was your age!
Hopes and dreams are precious!\xfffeBut they're not all...
You need more than hopes and dreams.\xfffeYou need to treasure... um, never mind.
I want a battle to refresh me!\xfffeSo, would you?
Thank yooou!\xfffeAh, how refreshing battles can be!
Okay, okay, I gotcha!\xfffeThat's enough for now!
Training wheels are fine, right?\xfffeGoing slow is fine, right?
I can do it myself, right?\xfffeI'll reach the goal someday, right?
It's okay to lose, right?\xfffeBecause I have my bike, right?
You won't even see my\xfffePokémon's moves coming at you!
You're too slow!
You met my speed...\xfffeJust what are you...?
I'm a newlywed, feeling fresh!\xfffeAnd I've got a kid!
We're kind of... in need.\xfffeHow about a congratulatory gift?
I know we've got to buy a house,\xfffebut we can enjoy Pokémon anywhere...
The hidden strength of a businessman...\xfffeshall be burnt into your vision!
That's one down!\xfffeYes! Truly the world's most skilled!
Smiling, but crying inside...\xfffeYep, that's a businessman! Grin!
The strictness of Pokémon\xfffebattles makes me weep...
Regrettable...\xfffeForgive me for today!
Would you remember my Pokémon\xfffedeep in your heart?
Who the heck do you think I am?!\xfffeI am the the patroller of the heavens!
You'd defy a policeman?\xfffeWho do you think YOU are?!
Believe you me, you will be caught...\xfffeBy I who patrols the heavens!
It's a little embarrassing,\xfffebut I used to be a naughty kid...
For a youth, you lack energy!\xfffeShall I train you?
Very well, very well...\xfffeBoys might as well be boys...
Squeek! Mop-squeep-squeek...\xfffeNuh? What? Battle?
Interrupting me during my work...\xfffeYou're impatient, you know that?
Ahhh! You made a mess\xfffeof the floor I just cleaned!
Life has only two rails!\xfffeLove or hate? That's all there is!
As a policeman, I choose\xfffeto take the rail of love!
The rail of hate is actually\xfffea bit of a shortcut...
I am a train, simply heading forth\xfffealong the decided rails!
You're a station I never stop at!\xfffeWe only pass each other by...
I think trains are incredible for\xfffecoming and going on the same paths!
I can't do work...\xfffeInstead, I'm really strong!
Seems I expected too much...\xfffeAnything but business!
I admire people who can make\xfffework and play coexist...
I HAVE BEEN WITH POKéMON\xfffeSINCE I WAS A CHILD
TO ME POKéMON ARE\xfffeNO DIFFERENT THAN FAMILY
PERHAPS IF I HAD CHILDREN\xfffeI WOULD GIVE THEM THESE
Hey! I'mma doctor!\xfffeHey-hey, time for an injection!
Okay! Injection time!\xfffeIt's alright! It REALLY hurts!
Wow, you're good!\xfffeSo, time for an injection!
Cough! Hack-cough!\xfffeHow many more people can I save...?
Cough! I wanted to save\xfffeso many more people! HACK!
A doctor can't neglect his own...\xfffeHAAACK! I can't take it anymore...
Do you want an injection?\xfffeOr maaaaaybe... an IV drip?
Injection? IV drip?\xfffeGosh, you're so greedy!
Ooh, I'm not feeling good!\xfffeYou're like poison IV to me!
Working this job, I've had\xfffea ton of miraculous experiences!
Why do I find myself so drawn\xfffeto ghost Pokémon, anyway?
Awww, I lost... By the way,\xfffewho's that behind you?
I've raised them too much... I can't...\xfffecarry these kids any longer...
It's the end...\xfffeNo one can stop them now...
They've finally calmed down...\xfffeThanks for the help...
Test the Pokémon you've\xfffetrained against me!
Hmph! That your best shot...?\xfffeI was hoping for better...
Whoa, whoa! You're nuts!!\xfffeThat is some Pokémon training!
Take a good look at my\xfffeamazingly-trained Pokémon!
My Pokémon are dear to me...\xfffeThey're friends to treasure!
Whoa, you're so strong and stylin'...\xfffeHrm, well, I won't lose next time!
I'm in the top percentage of breeders!\xfffeI'll tame any Pokémon you give me!
So? My Pokémon are SO\xfffeloyal to me, aren't they?
I must have pampered them too much...\xfffeThese guys aren't fit for battle...
Mukiki! I'm so gentle!\xfffeI'll give you a gentlemanly beating!
Muki! Mukiki!\xfffeMan, I'm SUCH a gentleman!
Mukiki! I'll remember this!\xfffeI'll beat you proper someday!
Long ago, my brother told me...\xfffe"The eyes! Aim for the eyes!"
So brother was right...\xfffeThank you... brother...
I lost to a brat, brother...\xfffeIf only I'd listened to you...
Even as you put on years,\xfffeluxury should never have to end!
As even brats should know,\xfffewealth makes worth in this world!
The habits of youth die hard,\xfffeeven with much age...
I'm a late-bloomer!\xfffeWatch me elegantly bloom!
Bloom, bloom, dance!\xfffeThe blossom of a lady's victory!
We don't want to wither as buds!\xfffePeople want to bloom and drop petals...
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeIt's the world's greatest pilot!
No good! No good at all!\xfffeYou'll never be on top!
You! You've got guts!\xfffeYou can fly with me next time!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeIt's the world's greatest pilot!
Got me? A trainer must\xfffetake first! Then take FIRSTER!
You're a skillful one!\xfffeBe my apprentice!
